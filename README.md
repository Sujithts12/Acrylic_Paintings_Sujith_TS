### 1️⃣ Serenity in Shadows – Buddha  
Warm golden tones merge with deep shadows to portray Buddha in a calm, meditative aura. The textured curls and glowing warmth represent inner balance beyond worldly noise.

A mysterious face emerges from soft shadows, adorned with expressive eyes and gentle ornaments. The partially undefined features create a hypnotic blend of grace and intrigue.

### 4️⃣ Vibrant Ganesha – Colors of Auspiciousness  
Bright strokes of orange, red, yellow, and green form a modern abstract of Lord Ganesha. The fluid curves bring out energy, positivity, and divine charm.

A pencil sketch of Ganesha beautifully framed against lush leaves and flowers. The artwork blends devotion with nature, creating an aesthetic reflection of purity and peace.

### 6️⃣ Why So Serious? – Joker Portrait
